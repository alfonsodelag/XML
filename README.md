# XML
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a metalanguage that was designed to describe information. Its main function is to help us organize content and that makes XML documents portable to different types of applications. It was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is used to store data in readable form.
Unlike other languages, XML supports databases, being useful when several applications must communicate with each other or integrate information. At present it has a very important role since it allows compatibility between systems to share information in a safe, reliable and easy way.
